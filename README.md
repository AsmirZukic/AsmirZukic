# Hi there, I'm Asmir Zukic ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong interest in Linux and open source projects. I enjoy working on projects that involve graphics and I'm currently diving into the fascinating world of building emulators. With a solid foundation in software engineering and a knack for problem-solving, I strive to create reliable and efficient solutions.

## Skills
- Programming Languages: Python, C++, Java
- Testing Frameworks: CUnit, JUnit, pytest
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Linux Administration
- Graphics Programming
- Emulator Development

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on recently:

### Mandelbrot Visualizer
A visually stunning Mandelbrot set visualizer built using C++ and the SDL2 library. This project combines the power of complex number mathematics and graphical rendering techniques to generate intricate and beautiful fractal patterns. The visualizer allows users to explore the Mandelbrot set by zooming in and panning around, providing an immersive and interactive experience.

### SDL Graphics Engine
I developed a versatile graphics engine using C++ and the SDL2 library. This engine focuses on real-time rendering and provides a solid foundation for creating interactive 2D and 3D graphical applications. It supports features such as texture mapping, lighting, and shader programming, enabling the creation of visually appealing graphics with ease.

### Chip8 Emulator
An emulator for the Chip8 virtual machine implemented in C++. This project involves low-level programming and emulation techniques to recreate the experience of running original Chip8 games and programs. The emulator accurately emulates the Chip8 system, including the CPU, memory, display, and input handling, providing a nostalgic retro gaming experience.

## Testing Framework
To ensure the reliability and correctness of my projects, I utilize the CUnit testing framework. CUnit is a lightweight and efficient unit testing framework for C and C++ applications. It allows me to write and execute tests to verify the functionality of my code, ensuring that it meets the desired specifications and behaves as expected.
